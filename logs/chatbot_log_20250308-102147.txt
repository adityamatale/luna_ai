responded: I'm sorry for the repetition. Let me analyze the uploaded document for you.



[0m[33;1m[1;3mRelinquishment
A relinquishment is extinguishment of a right, therefore, it cannot amount 
to a transfer. A relinquishment by a reversioner of his reversio nary 
interest does not amount to transfer. Where a person in whose fa vour the 
release is executed gets certain rights by virtue of such releas e and such 
transaction may amount to transfer.
Can future property be transferred? 
If a contract to transfer future property is made, it will not b e enforced 
before the property comes into existence. The contract to transfer future 
property will be specifically performed only on coming into exis tence 
of that property.
