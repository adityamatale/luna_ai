24. Contract Amendment
Contract Type:Â Procurement
We canâ€™t all get it right the first time, soÂ contract amendmentsÂ are a necessary part of doing business. Amendments can be used to modify the terms of the contract, the parties involved, or the duration of the contract.
New clauses can be added or existing clauses deleted from the contract with an amendment. To amend a contract, identify the clause that needs to be changed and draft an amendment that specifically states the change. Once an amendment has been signed by both parties, it becomes legally binding and cannot be modified without both parties' consent.
