The quantum of variable pay is based on company and individual
performance. Variable pay is given in the form of performance bonus or
incentives as applicable.

Merit Pay: 
Definition: 
âˆ‘Merit pay is an approach to compensation that rewards the higher performing employees with 
additional pay or incentive pay. Merit pay has advantages and disadvantages for the employees and

compensation. Instead of tying raises solely to time on the job or promotion to a higher position, 
the company gives raises for superior performance. For example, a pizzeria can give merit pay 
raises for managers who successfully control ingredient costs. A medical billing company can offer 
merit pay raises for employees who collect a higher percentage of outstanding bills. When an 
employee receives a merit pay incentive, her salary is permanently increased.
