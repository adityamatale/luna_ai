Human: to  Okay. That is great. Can you mention what are the criteria that unemployments need to be eligible for additional benefits?
LLM (8698ms): I'm sorry for the confusion earlier. Since there is no user-uploaded contract or specific context about employment, I'll provide a general response.

For unemployment benefits, eligibility criteria typically include:

1. Being unemployed through no fault of your own.
2. Meeting the work and wage requirements in the base period.
3. Being physically able to work.
4. Being available for work.
5. Registering with the state employment service.
6. Actively seeking work.

Additional benefits may have additional criteria. For example, in some cases, additional benefits may be available for those who have dependents or who have been unemployed for an extended period. However, the specific criteria can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the type of benefit.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with! ðŸ˜Š
