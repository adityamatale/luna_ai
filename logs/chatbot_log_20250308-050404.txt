According to Dessler (2014, 2019), employee compensation and beneﬁts include all
forms of pay going to employees and arising from their employment, besides their regular
wages or salaries. They are comprised of direct ﬁnancial payments (the 13th payment,
bonuses, proﬁt-sharing, etc.) and indirect ﬁnancial payments (medical coverage, health
insurance, paid vacations, etc.). To Leibowitz (1983), beneﬁts are classiﬁed into three
categories. The ﬁrst one is nontaxable for private utilization and includes health insurance,
sponsored lunches in the ﬁrm (also known as a brown bag), etc. The second and third
categories are taxable. In the second category are beneﬁts such as life insurance, which
the employer can offer at a low cost, due to the quantity rebates, while the third category
comprises paid time off. Mura and Svec (2018), as stated in Per áˇ cek (2020), use the term

comprises paid time off. Mura and Svec (2018), as stated in Per áˇ cek (2020), use the term
‘remuneration’ which they argue means not only the salary or other cash remuneration
but also other forms of indirect compensation of employees for the work done by them. It
also includes formal recognition, promotion, and employment beneﬁts provided by the
employer to employees, not depending on their work, but derived from working relations
in the organization.
Beneﬁts are an important element of employees’ aggregate compensation, so they
affect their welfare and ﬁnancial well-being (Kristal 2017). Although the job itself might
be a motivator to continue working and increase the company’s performance, most of the
employees would choose not to. Another option would be to only choose jobs that are
enjoyable for the employee but not essentially required by the community (Lazear 2018).[0m[32;1m[1;3m

Abstract: The Compensation and Beneﬁts Package is considered the main employee’s motivator. As
such, it plays a crucial role in determining successful recruiting, engagement, and retention strategies.
Failing to offer the right package, will be translated into additional costs. This study aimed to identify
what type of compensation and beneﬁts Albanian employees receive and their relationship with job
satisfaction, before and after COVID-19. We surveyed 127 employees and conducted 10 in-depth
interviews, in different institutions in Albania. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to
analyze the data. The ﬁndings showed that most received beneﬁts are medical insurance and bonuses,
and employees are less than considerably satisﬁed with their package. The majority stated that it had
