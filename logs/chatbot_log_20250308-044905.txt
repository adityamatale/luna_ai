Human: What are the no cash benefits provided by a company to their employees?

[0m[36;1m[1;3mthe employer can offer at a low cost, due to the quantity rebates, while the third category
comprises paid time off. Mura and Svec (2018), as stated in Per áˇ cek (2020), use the term
‘remuneration’ which they argue means not only the salary or other cash remuneration
but also other forms of indirect compensation of employees for the work done by them. It
also includes formal recognition, promotion, and employment beneﬁts provided by the
employer to employees, not depending on their work, but derived from working relations
in the organization.
Beneﬁts are an important element of employees’ aggregate compensation, so they
affect their welfare and ﬁnancial well-being (Kristal 2017). Although the job itself might
be a motivator to continue working and increase the company’s performance, most of the
employees would choose not to. Another option would be to only choose jobs that are
enjoyable for the employee but not essentially required by the community (Lazear 2018).

offered when a new employee is hired, or when changes are made to the Pay Plan, often
do not do their job. This, combined with the fact that employees are receiving fewer
beneﬁts compared to what they would prefer, contributes to their dissatisfaction with the
Compensation and Beneﬁts Package.
The most received beneﬁts are medical insurance, year-end bonuses, and bonuses,
where the highest received percentage is below sixty percent. However, when around
seventy-two percent of employees state they would prefer to receive bonuses, and only
forty-four percent do, it shows a mismatch between what they expect and what they receive
(Expectancy theory).
More employees would like to receive a higher payment and keep the ratio of
wage/beneﬁts as it is. The difference though was small, so it cannot be stated with
complete certainty that Albanian employees prefer money more than beneﬁts.
The pandemic changed employee lifestyles, reshaped business models, and dictated

working in the company is worrisome. Does th is happen because those employees do not 
receive any benefits, or are the ones responsible for providing information negligent? 
The answer to that can be found in the responses given on what types of benefits 
employees receive. As we can see from Figure  1, the most received benefits are medical 
insurance with 57.5%, followed by year-end bonuses with 48% and bonuses with 44.1%, 
while the least received are extended paternity leave (0.8%), daycare service, stock option,
