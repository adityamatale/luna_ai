[32;1m[1;3m[Question]: Give me a sum summary of the relevant documents related to sales deed of land.
[Thought]: The user is asking for a summary of documents related to a sales deed of land. I can use the 'land\_assessment' tool to gather this information.
[Action]: land\_assessment
[Action Input]: {"query": "sales deed of land"}
[Observation]: The sales deed of land is a legal document that transfers ownership of property from the seller to the buyer. It should be registered with the sub-registrar of assurances and must contain details such as the property's location, description, and the parties involved. Other relevant documents include the encumbrance certificate, which verifies that the property has no liens or legal issues, and the tax receipts, which show that the property taxes are up-to-date.
[Thought]: I now know the final answer
[Final Answer]: A sales deed of land is a legal document that transfers property ownership. Relevant documents include the encumbrance certificate and tax receipts.[0m
